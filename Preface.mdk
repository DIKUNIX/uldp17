# Preface

The following notes were originally developed by Oleks and Morten in
preparation for a 1-day course for high-school students in 2015. They were
later expanded upon by Oleks and Troels in 2016 in preparation for a week-long
course for (among others) 2nd-year students at DIKU. In 2017, Oleks rewrote the
notes in [Madoko], and added a section on Makefiles.
