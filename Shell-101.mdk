# Shell 101

Dear to the heart of a Unix-like operating system is a command-line interface
with the operating system, often referred to as a "shell", or "terminal".

A [Command-Line Interface
(CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) interprets textual
commands, rather than e.g.  mouse clicks, or gestures. A CLI presents you with
a line where you can enter text, and "prompts" you to enter a command.
