# Shell 101

Dear to the heart of a Unix-like operating system is a command-line interface
with the operating system, often referred to as a “shell”, or “terminal”.

A Command-Line Interface (CLI) interprets textual commands, rather than mouse
clicks or gestures. A CLI presents you with a line where you can enter text,
and “prompts” you to enter a command.
